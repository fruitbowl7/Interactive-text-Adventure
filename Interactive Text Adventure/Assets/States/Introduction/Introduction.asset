  storyText: ' The smell of tea and biscuits in the morning has always been your
    favorite. You sit down on your balcony with a slight breeze of cool wind hitting
    your face. You watch the sunrise like you have every morning. Then suddenly you
    hear banging from your door. What do you do?


    1 - Open the door carefully
    to see who is on the other side

    2 - Yell at the mysterious person to go
    away
