  storyText: "You decide to take the right staircase because right is always right,
    right? You walk half way up the stairs wondering if you should have chosen this
    one. But you have nothing to lose, except your life, you sprint up the stairs
    closing your eyes. You randomly bump into a wall, you open your eyes then BAM.
    You turn around and notice that you just ran into a box. You sigh knowing you're
    gonna die. All of a sudden the floor beneath you opens, and you fall into water.
    What do you do?\r\n\n1 - Just accept that ur going to drown \r\n2 - Try to escape\r\n"
