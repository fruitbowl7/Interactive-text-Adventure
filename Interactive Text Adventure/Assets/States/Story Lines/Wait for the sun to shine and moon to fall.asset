    to hear a noise. You open your eyes and you feel your body slightly start to
    fall back. You start to get up and grab your bag. The sun has risen and the moon
    has set. As you walk through the gates you notice how overgrown and beautiful
    it looks. You see two paths that you could take. One is a rocky path covered
    in greenery, the other is a smooth path also covered in greenery . \r\n\n1 -
