  storyText: 'You decide to take the left staircase because you don''t trust that
    the right staircase is the right one. You start to walk up the stairs quickly,
    you notice that there''s a door at the top. You run to the door, once you get
    there you open the door, and all you see is a dark room. You walk in cautiously
    trying to find some sort of light, you look around and you see a candle lit up
    in the corner. You walk over to grab it , it looks like it just has been lit
    but you just ignore it. You turn around and you notice the book, you walk up
    to it. What do you do?
