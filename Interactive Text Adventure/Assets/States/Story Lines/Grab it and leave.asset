  storyText: 'You carefully grab the book and leave. You walk out the doors hoping
    you''re okay, and you are. You leave the way you came, you get back to your boat
    safely after a week or two. You take the eagle river to get back. You give the
    book to the queen, she thanks you for your bravery and gives you a hefty reward.
    I wonder why she needed the book, I guess we''ll never know.
