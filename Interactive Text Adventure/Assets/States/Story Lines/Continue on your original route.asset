    in only 2 days! You see a shiny light coming from not too far away. You notice
    there are two ways you could get there. One way is a long, but safe, passageway.
    But there is a faster way, but it is a little bit less safe. Which one will you
    take?\r\n\n1 - Take the longer, but safer route \r\n2 - Take the shorter, but
    less safe route\r\n"
