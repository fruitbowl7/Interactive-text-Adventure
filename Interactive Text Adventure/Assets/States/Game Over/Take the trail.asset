  storyText: "You start to walk on the trail, it is very overgrown but you pay no
    attention to it. You walk for a good 20 minutes before you  hit a dead end. You
    should just stop taking shortcuts. All of a sudden you hear rustling through
    the trees and bushes. A group of people jump out and grab you. They start to
    grab all your things, then one of them reaches out of the pocute, takes the knife
    and stabs you. You really need to stop taking shortcuts. \r\n\n1 - Try again?\r\n2
