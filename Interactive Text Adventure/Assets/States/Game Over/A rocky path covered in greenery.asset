  storyText: 'You walk for hours, yet it feels like weeks, your feet ache, your shoes
    are starting to tear. But it looks as though the end of the path is near. As
    you walk closer you realize that it''s a dead end, all there is, is a brick wall.
    But maybe it''s a hidden door you think. You start to press the wall hoping for
    something. You''ve pressed every brick except one, you press the brick and it
    seems as the wall starts to move back. But it stops, then all of a sudden you
    fall. You start to freak out, you look around and see you''re falling into a
    pit with sharp poles at the bottom. Wow, you really need to get better at choosing
    options.


    1 - Try again

    2 - Quit
