  storyText: "You realize there's a little gap of air, you swim up and take a breath.
    You dive back down looking around trying to find some sort of way to escape.
    You just keep diving down, not releasing ur slowly losing breath faster. You
    see a door, how and why is there a door, you don't know or care. You're so close
    to the door, but now you're seriously losing air. You try to swim as fast as
    you can to the air pocket, but you don't make it in time. I wonder if you should
    have tried to open the door. \r\n\n1 - Try again\r\n2 - Quit\r\n"
